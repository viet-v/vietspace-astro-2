                    “What should I do with my career?”
                    <br/><br/>
                    That question has kept me curious for years. I took my courage to stop sitting at university in ambiguity and instead find lessons in real life. I have been through many roles at a young age, have worked with so many people from different backgrounds, have grown a lot more both personally and professionally. I found these lessons invaluable and the journey to find the answer is still long, but it’s worth it.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Covid hit, I took myself away from the hustle, found time for reflection. There, from the roles I’ve been through, I realized I took the most motivation from 2 things: technology and helping people. I used to think it would be awesome if I could code some useful websites or applications to share things or help people’s lives better. But it was just a fantasy since I was not good at programming class in high school, so I thought I would just stop with Adobe Suite, making videos and managing databases.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Not until I saw this question <b>“Wondering if tech is right for you?”</b> from Skillcrush did I start to gain confidence. And from the moment I committed to spending days and nights watching videos, reading blogs, drawing mockups, practicing to code, it was like a dream where I could plan my projects, design and code from scratch, and watch it become a real product! It’s like the feeling you are much closer to something you once thought impossible.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The more I learned the more I realized it’s not all about tech skills. Tech needs people, this industry needs people who deeply understand their customers, show empathy and support to their coworkers and are passionate about delivering the best values.
                    <br/><br/>
                    That thought reinforces me, helps me fight imposter syndrome and boosts my aspiration to become a valuable team member.
